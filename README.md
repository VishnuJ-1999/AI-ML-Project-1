Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project (both training and testing) was synthetically generated using a deep learning model trained on an Exam Score Prediction dataset.

The generated data closely resembles the original dataset, but the feature distributions are not exactly the same. This introduces slight variations that help reflect real-world data inconsistencies.

The original Exam Score Prediction dataset can be used to:

Analyze and understand the underlying data patterns

Compare feature distributions between original and generated data

Experiment with combining both datasets during model training to potentially improve performance

Using both datasets can help build models that are more robust and better at generalizing to unseen data.
